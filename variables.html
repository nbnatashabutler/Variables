<p>Parsing Reassigning Concatenating Variables Appending Copying Escaping<p>
<p>In PHP, variables are assigned values with the assignment operator (=).

Variable names can contain numbers, letters, and underscores (_). A sigil ($) must always precede a variable name. They cannot start with a number and they cannot have spaces or any special characters.

The convention in PHP is to use snake case for variable naming; this means that lowercase words are delimited with an underscore character (_). Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>

pre>Parse $my_var = "cat";
 
echo "There is one $my_var on the mat";
 
/* If there were three cats, then you can type: */
echo "There are three {$my_var}s on the mat ";
/* The curly braces help to avoid confusion between the variable name and the letter s, so PHP does not consider the variable name as my_vars */ </pre>
<pre>Reasign $var1 = "Bob";
echo $var1;
// var1 holds the value "Bob"
 
$var1 = "John";
echo $var1;
// var1 now holds the value "John" </pre>

<pre>Concatenate echo "Hello,"." welcome to Codecademy!";
// prints - Hello, welcome to Codecademy! </pre>
<pre>Append $str = "Hello, ";
$str .= "World!";
 
echo $str;
// Output: Hello, World!  </pre>
<pre>Copy $original = "Ice T";
$copy = $original;
$orginal = "Iced Tea";
echo $copy; // "Ice T";</pre>
<pre>Escape echo "Hello, World!\nThis is a String!";
/* prints-
Hello, World!
This is a String!
*/ </pre>




<h3>Ruby<h3>
<p>In Ruby, a variable is a place to store values of almost any type including Integer, Boolean, String, Array, and Hashes.

Each variable has its own name which cannot begin with a capital letter or a number and we use the equal sign for assigning a value to that variable.

The variable declaration does not require that you mention a specific data type.

The following program declares myvar variable and assigns the value 48.

<p>
<pre>myVar = 48 </pre>
<em>print</em> is similar to inline and <em>puts</em> is similar to block in html</p>

<h3>Swift<h3>
<p>Variables Constants Type: Int Double String Bool UIButton UIViewController UISwitch CLLocationManager<p>
<p>explicit</p>
<pre> var score:Int = 0  </pre>
<p>inferred</p>
<pre> var score = 0 </pre>
<p>constant cannot be reassigned</p>
<pre>let value = 3 + 3.1415</pre>


<h3>R<h3>
<p>R does not have a command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. To assign a value to a variable, use the <- sign. To output (or print) the variable value, just type the variable name:<p>
pre> name <- "John Doe"

print(name)
</pre>
<pre>name <- "John"
age <- 40

name   
age </pre>

<h3>Java<h3>
<p>int char boolea byte long short double float null<p>
pre>char answer = 'y'; </pre>
<pre> </pre>

<h3>Python<h3>
<p>A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character _.

The equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed.<p>
pre>user_name = "@sonnynomnom"
user_id = 100
verified = False
 
# A variable's value can be changed after assignment
 
points = 100
points = 120 </pre>


<h3>Javascript Variables<h3>
<p>Start them with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
After the first letter, you can use numbers, as well as letters, underscores, or dollar signs.
Don’t use any of JavaScript’s reserved keywords.<p>
<p>re-assignable variable</p>
pre> var x = 100;
var y = x + 102;
y;</pre>
<p> constant</p>
<pre>let name = "Tammy";</pre>
